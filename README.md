# StudyTimeTracker
## Study time tracking application

This is project for Study time tracking application. 
The idea is to track time spent studying, time spent doing excercises and time spent working on projects.

Project will be build with Java and is currently in draft.

Work log:

- **7/24/2017** - Rough sketch on what the app will look like

- **7/26/2017** - Interface is OK for now. I have the main layout. Code is refactored, still a lot of work to do, but looks OK for now.
Next steps are to put some code behind the interface.
